## Technologies I use:

- Typescript
- Express
- MongoDB
- JWT
- Postman (testing API)

## Getting The Server Up

I set up a basic project structure with awakening a server with Express and some routes to test if the server was well configured.

## Getting MongoDB Ready

As I'm Using WSL to work I had to install mongoDB in it. I followed this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#:~:text=the%20PostgreSQL%20extension.-,Install%20MongoDB,-To%20install%20MongoDB) to get it working.

- To get the database running I created the alias **s_mongo**.
